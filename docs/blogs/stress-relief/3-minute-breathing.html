  <p>
    Feeling overwhelmed or tense? This simple breathing exercise can help you reset your mind in just 3 minutes — no special tools or space required.
  </p>

  <h2>Step 1: Find a Comfortable Seat</h2>
  <p>
    Sit upright in a chair or cross-legged on the floor. Rest your hands on your lap or knees and gently close your eyes if you're comfortable.
  </p>

  <h2>Step 2: Inhale Slowly</h2>
  <p>
    Breathe in through your nose for a count of four. Feel your chest and belly rise as you fill your lungs with air.
  </p>

  <h2>Step 3: Hold and Exhale</h2>
  <p>
    Hold the breath for a count of two, then exhale gently through your mouth for a count of six. Let your shoulders relax as you release the air.

  <h2>Step 4: Repeat</h2>
  <p>
    Repeat this cycle — inhale (4), hold (2), exhale (6) — for 3 minutes. Focus your attention on the rhythm of your breath.
  </p>

  <p>
    <strong>This exercise can be done during a break, before a meeting, or anytime you need a moment to reset.</strong> Try it daily for lasting calm.
