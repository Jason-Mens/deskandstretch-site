            <p>Shutting down your computer doesn't always mean your mind switches off. Try these low-effort ways to unwind after a remote workday — no need to go anywhere.</p>

            <h2>1. Tea & Silence</h2>
            <p>Make a warm cup of herbal tea. Sit by a window. Just 5 minutes of stillness can reset your energy and calm your nerves.</p>

            <h2>2. Guided Breathing</h2>
            <p>Use a 5-minute YouTube breathing video or phone app. Breathe in deeply through your nose and out through your mouth. It works wonders for mental clarity.</p>

            <h2>3. Change Your Clothes</h2>
            <p>Switch out of work clothes, even if it's just into a clean tee. It signals your brain that the workday is over.</p>

            <p><strong>Remember:</strong> Little rituals can make a big difference in separating work from rest when you work from home.</p>
