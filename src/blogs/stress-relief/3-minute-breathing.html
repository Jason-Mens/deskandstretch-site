            <!-- Step 1 -->
            <div class="card">
                <h2>üßò 1. Find Stillness ‚Äî Create Your Reset Space</h2>
                <div class="why">Why it works:</div>
                <p>Your body and mind need a clear signal that it's time to shift gears. A dedicated space helps your nervous system understand it's safe to relax.</p>
                <div style="font-weight: bold;">Try this:</div>
                <ul>
                    <li>Sit somewhere quiet ‚Äî your sofa, the floor, or by a window. Close your eyes if you feel comfortable.</li>
                    <li>Let your hands rest softly on your legs. Unclench your jaw. Drop your shoulders.</li>
                </ul>
                <div class="callout">Pro Tip: Choose a spot away from your work area to create a clear mental boundary.</div>

                </div>
            </div>

            <!-- Step 2 -->
            <div class="card">
                <h2>üå¨Ô∏è 2. Begin the Rhythm ‚Äî Box Breathing</h2>
                <div class="why">Why it works:</div>
                <p>Box breathing activates your parasympathetic nervous system, which is your body's natural relaxation response. It's used by athletes and even Navy SEALs to reduce stress.</p>
                <div style="font-weight: bold;">Try this:</div>
                <ul>
                    <li>Inhale for 4 seconds</li>
                    <li>Hold for 4 seconds</li>
                    <li>Exhale for 4 seconds</li>
                    <li>Hold again for 4 seconds</li>
                </ul>
                <div class="callout">Repeat for 4 cycles (around 1 minute and 15 seconds total). Focus on the rhythm, not perfection.</div>

            <div class="card">
                <h2>üß† 3. Let the Noise Fade ‚Äî Mental Reset</h2>
                <div class="why">Why it works:</div>
                <p>When you focus on your breath, you're giving your mind a single point of attention. This naturally quiets the mental chatter and reduces cortisol levels.</p>
                <div style="font-weight: bold;">Try this:</div>
                <ul>
                    <li>With each round, imagine tension leaving your body ‚Äî like fog lifting off your shoulders.</li>
                    <li>If your mind wanders, that's okay. Just bring it gently back to your breath.</li>
                </ul>
                <div class="callout">Remember: You don't need to force anything. The breath is enough.</div>

                <h2>üîÅ 4. Repeat as Needed ‚Äî Build Your Reset Habit</h2>
                <div class="why">Why it works:</div>
                <p>Consistency builds the habit, and the habit becomes your automatic stress response. Over time, your body learns to relax more quickly.</p>
                <div style="font-weight: bold;">Try this:</div>
                <ul>
