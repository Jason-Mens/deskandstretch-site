    Want to strengthen your core without leaving the house or using equipment? Here’s a short, effective 10-minute routine you can do right next to your desk.
  </p>

  <h2>1. Plank (30 seconds)</h2>
  <p>
    Keep your body in a straight line from head to heels. Engage your core and avoid sagging.

  <h2>2. Bicycle Crunches (30 seconds)</h2>
  <p>
    Lie on your back and alternate bringing your elbow to the opposite knee. Great for the obliques!
  </p>

  <h2>3. Leg Raises (30 seconds)</h2>
  <p>
    Lie flat, lift your legs to 90°, and lower them slowly without touching the ground. Targets the lower abs.
  </p>

  <h2>4. Mountain Climbers (30 seconds)</h2>
  <p>
    From a plank position, drive your knees to your chest alternately. It’s cardio and core in one!
  </p>

  <h2>Repeat</h2>
  <p>
    Rest for 30 seconds, then repeat the circuit one more time for a complete 10-minute session.
  </p>

  <p><strong>Do this routine 3–4 times a week to build strength and boost energy during your workday.</strong></p>
