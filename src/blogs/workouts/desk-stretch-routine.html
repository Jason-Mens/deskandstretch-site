      <p>
        Sitting all day can make your shoulders stiff, your back ache, and your legs restless. Here’s a quick stretch routine you can do at your desk — no gym, no mat, just movement.
      </p>

      <h2>1. Neck Rolls</h2>
      <p>
        Slowly tilt your head to one side, then roll it forward and around to the other side. Repeat 5 times. This helps release neck tension caused by staring at screens.

      <h2>2. Shoulder Shrugs</h2>
      <p>
        Raise both shoulders toward your ears, hold for 3 seconds, and release. Do this 10 times to wake up tired shoulders.
      </p>

      <h2>3. Seated Spinal Twist</h2>
      <p>
        Sit up straight. Place your right hand on the back of your chair and twist to the right, holding for 10 seconds. Repeat on the left side.
      </p>

      <h2>4. Forward Fold</h2>
      <p>
        Stand up, hinge at your hips, and let your arms and head hang. It’s great for decompressing your spine and letting blood flow to your head.
      </p>

      <h2>5. Wrist Stretch</h2>
      <p>
        Stretch out your arms and gently pull back on your fingers with the opposite hand. Switch hands. Typing all day can cause tight wrists!
      </p>

      <p><strong>Try doing these stretches every 2–3 hours during your workday.</strong> Your body will thank you!</p>
